After eating, she decided to trace patterns on the ice with her skates. She drew the outline of a whale and some tiny mice playing together. The ice sparkled like white rice scattered across the rink. 

While practicing her jumps, Emma noticed her shoelace had come undone. She sat down carefully and tied it with a neat bow. The lace felt smooth between her fingers. 

When it was time to leave, Emma threw her dice into her skating bag. She had been playing a game with her friend earlier. Tomorrow she would return to skate again while the weather stayed cold. Emma couldn't wait to smile and glide across the beautiful ice once more.`

Ice is actually lighter than water, which is why ice cubes float in your drink. This happens because ice takes up more space than water. Scientists can trace the age of ice by studying ice cores from places like Antarctica.

Many animals love ice. Polar bears and whales live in icy waters while penguins slide across ice at their own pace. Even tiny mice can survive in cold places by making warm nests.

People use ice in many ways. We put ice in drinks, use ice to keep food fresh on a plate, and some people love to skate on ice rinks. Hockey players need sharp skate blades, almost like a knife cutting through the ice.

If you smile and look closely at ice, you can see beautiful crystal patterns. Some people even use dice made of ice for special games!`

First, skating is great exercise. You move at your own pace while building strong leg muscles. It's much more fun than sitting inside playing with dice or watching TV on a plate of snacks.

Second, skating teaches you balance and confidence. You learn to trace smooth paths across the ice, just like drawing with a knife through butter. Even if you fall, you get back up with a smile!

Third, skating connects you with nature. You might skate on a frozen pond where you could see mice tracks in the snow or imagine whales swimming beneath the thick ice.

Finally, skating gives you a useful skill. You can race with friends, play hockey, or just glide peacefully. Your shoelace might come undone, but that's easy to fix. 

Don't wait any longer - start skating while the weather is perfect for ice sports!`

Trace the patterns, round and square,
Like a whale swimming through icy air.
At my own pace, I glide and spin,
With lace boots tied and a happy grin.

Mice scurry past the rink's warm edge,
While I practice jumps near the snowy ledge.
My lunch plate waits with rice and meat,
But first I'll make this dance complete.

Roll the dice to pick my song,
While the ice stays smooth and strong.
Step by step and glide by glide,
Smile bright with winter pride.

When the day comes to an end,
While saying goodbye to my skating friend,
I trace one final, graceful line,
This ice-cold sport is simply divine!`

If there's a fire, stay brave and remember your escape plan. Don't rage or panic, even though you might feel scared. The ground might seem to quake with fear, but keep calm and move quickly to safety.

Never leave burning candles unattended or use electrical items with broken fuse wires. Keep matches and lighters in a secure place, like a locked cage away from children.

Practice fire drills at home and school. Know where to meet outside, and never go back inside for toys or pets. A brave person knows when it's time to chase safety instead of trying to fight the blaze alone.`

Third, performing teaches confidence. You'll learn to speak clearly so the huge audience can hear every word. Don't worry if you feel nervous - even professional actors get stage fright. That feeling will quake through you at first, but it gets easier.

Suddenly, she started to sneeze because of some flowers nearby. "Please excuse me," she said politely, even though she was alone. Maya had to squeeze her nose to stop the sneezing fit.

First, eat healthy foods. Please include fruits, vegetables, and foods like cheese that give you calcium for strong bones. Don't tease your parents when they serve vegetables - they really do help you grow!

Second, get enough sleep. Your body needs rest to grow and learn. Create a bedtime routine and avoid looking at a bright screen before bed. This helps your brain relax so you can dream peacefully.

Third, exercise regularly. You might squeal with joy when you play outside! Run by a stream, ride your bike, or play games that make you squeeze your muscles and move around.

Fourth, practice good hygiene. Please wash your hands often and cover your mouth when you sneeze. This stops germs from spreading to others.

When it's cold enough to freeze outside, dress warmly. Sweet dreams, good food, exercise, and cleanliness will keep you healthy and strong all year long!`

Pet owners should follow this important quote: "With great love comes great responsibility." Don't get a pet unless you can care for it properly. A dog or cat isn't a clone of a toy - they have real needs and feelings.

Birds fly high to catch strong winds that help them travel faster. Some birds are blind to colors we can see, but they use other senses to navigate. They can find their way using the light from stars and the sun's position.

Migration is kind of like a schedule. Birds must grind their way through long distances, stopping only for short rests. Their flight muscles are packed tight with energy, and even a slight change in weather can affect their journey.

Scientists use special tools to find and track wild birds. They put small, light bands on birds' legs that don't hurt them. This helps researchers learn about each bird's individual flight path.

If you're the kind of child who loves nature, try watching for migrating birds at night. You might find some amazing sights when you look up high at the dark sky filled with traveling birds.`

Second, don't grind up natural areas for no reason. Wild animals need safe places to rest during their long journeys. A small child can help by not disturbing bird nests or animal homes.

Third, be the kind of person who cares about all creatures. Even if you find animals that seem strange or scary, remember they have the right to live too.

Finally, learn about the wild animals in your area. Find books about local birds and their night flight patterns. When you understand how animals live, you'll naturally want to be more kind to them and help protect their homes.`
