When someone would knock on the door during their lessons, Grandma would tie a knot in her work and put it down. Emma's knee sometimes got sore from kneeling on the floor, but she didn't mind. From the small hill behind their house, Emma could see other families spending time together on weekends.`

Long ago, knitters would kneel on the ground or sit on small hills while working with needles made from wood or bone. Learning to knit requires people to know how to work with wool and twist it into strong yarn. When knitters need to stop their work, they must tie a safe knot so their work doesn't come apart. Old knitting needles were much sharper than today's needles. Students who want to know about knitting history must study how different people developed special ways to make beautiful clothes.`

Kneel beside the window bright,
Knoll outside in morning light.

Knit the stitches, row by row,
Knot the yarn as off we go!`
