One day, Lucy noticed a slight movement in Mrs. Johnson's garden. She might have missed it if she hadn't been looking in just the right direction. A small rabbit had made its home in what looked like a pig sty, but was actually an old wooden box.

Lucy tried to pry open her notebook to write down what she saw, but the pages wouldn't ply apart easily. She had to fight the urge to make noise while she watched the rabbit.

The sight of the cute animal made Lucy forget to be shy. She crept closer, being careful not to injure her thigh on the fence. The rabbit looked right at her with its big, dark eyes.

Lucy realized that being a spy might not be right for her after all. She preferred making friends with the animals rather than spying on them in a sly way.`

Some people think shy kids are sly or trying to spy on others, but that's not true. A shy child might simply need more time to feel comfortable. They're not trying to fight anyone or be difficult.

Being shy doesn't mean you can't be strong. You might surprise people with a slight smile that shows your true personality. Don't let anyone pry into your feelings if you're not ready to share.

Some shy people become great writers, artists, or scientists. They use their quiet nature to observe the world around them. The sight of a shy person thinking deeply is actually quite beautiful.

If you're shy, remember that you have the right to take your time. You might need to ply yourself slowly into new situations. Don't fight your natural personality - work with it to become the best version of yourself.`

Sometimes you need to spy on situations to see what's really happening. If you sight someone being mean to another kid, don't just walk away. You have the right to speak up, even if you feel nervous about it.

Being brave doesn't mean you can't be shy. You might feel a slight tremor in your thigh when you're scared, but that's okay. Don't let bullies pry on your kindness or use your quiet nature against you.

Try to ply your courage like a muscle - the more you use it, the stronger it gets. You don't have to fight with your fists. Sometimes the right words are more powerful than any physical action.

Remember, even shy people can be heroes. You might not be sly or loud, but you can still make a difference. When you sight something wrong, your quiet strength can help others feel safe and supported.`

And wonder how they learned to fly.

Don't try to fight my quiet way,
Or pry apart what I won't say.
My slight smile shows I'm okay,
I'm just not loud like kids at play.

The sight of bullies makes me mad,
When right seems lost, it makes me sad.
I might feel scared, my thigh might shake,
But I'll still fight for others' sake.

You can't ply me to be loud,
Or make me blend into the crowd.
I have the right to be just me,
Shy but strong as I can be.

So when you spy a quiet kid,
Don't assume they're something hid.
We might be shy, but we can fight
For everything that's good and right!`

Maria sat on a fallen log and began to draw the peaceful scene. A large boar appeared at the water's edge, its coarse hair glistening in the morning sun. She watched the animal's powerful muscles as it bent down to drink.

Suddenly, she heard a loud roar from across the lake. An eagle began to soar high above the trees, its wings spread wide against the pink dawn sky. Maria quickly sketched the magnificent bird on her drawing board.

As she worked, Maria noticed an old wooden oar half-buried in the straw and leaves near the shore. Someone must have lost it from their boat. She decided to crawl closer to get a better look, being careful not to let her claw-like pencil grip smear her artwork.

The roar of the morning wind through the trees made the perfect background music for her peaceful drawing session.`

The wild boar is a strong animal with coarse, bristly hair. Don't try to crawl too close to one - they can roar loudly when they feel threatened! A boar uses its claw-like hooves to dig for food in the forest floor.

Birds soar high above the trees, looking for food and safe places to nest. Their sharp claw talons help them catch fish and small animals. Some birds make a soft cooing sound, while others roar like thunder when they call to each other.

If you're drawing animals, bring a sturdy board to lean on. Use coarse paper that won't tear easily. Sit on your lawn or find a comfortable spot where you can watch without disturbing the wildlife.

Remember to bring an oar if you're taking a boat to observe water animals. The straw-colored reeds by the water make perfect hiding spots for many creatures. Early dawn is often the best time to see shy forest animals.`

At dawn each day, amazing creatures wake up in forests around the world. Eagles soar through the sky while other animals crawl through the coarse undergrowth looking for food. We must draw attention to the problems facing these habitats.

People cut down trees to build houses and plant lawn grass where forests used to grow. This destroys homes for animals who need straw, leaves, and fallen logs for shelter. When a bear gives a warning roar, it might be telling us to stay away from its shrinking home.

You can help by not littering. Don't throw boards, plastic, or other trash where animals might step on it with their claw feet. Even an old oar left by a stream can harm wildlife.

Join forest cleanup days in your community. Help plant new trees and remove coarse weeds that don't belong. Every small action helps these wild places soar back to health.`

Wild creatures wake and start to thrive.
The boar with coarse and bristly hair
Searches for breakfast everywhere.

I crawl quietly through morning dew,
My drawing board and pencils too.
I want to draw what eagles see
When high above they soar so free.

The old oak tree begins to roar
As morning wind shakes every pore.
A rabbit's claw marks in the straw
Show where it hopped without a flaw.

An ancient oar lies by the stream,
Like something from a distant dream.
The coarse bark patterns on each tree
Tell stories of what used to be.

So when you walk across your lawn,
Remember creatures of the dawn.
Let forests soar and wildness stay,
To roar with life another day!`

The knight's thick beard was already damp with sweat as he approached the tower. He raised his spear high and gave a mighty shout that echoed off the stone walls. The crowd below held their breath.

But instead of fighting, something amazing happened. The dragon began to cry, and a single clear tear fell from its eye. Sir William realized the dragon wasn't mean - it was just lonely and afraid.

It's clear that emotions help us understand the world. When you see a crowd of happy people, their joy might make you feel good too. If you're in a tall tower or high place, you might feel fear of heights - that's your body trying to keep you safe.

Adults often have a beard or mustache that can hide their facial expressions. Try to look at their eyes instead - that's where you can see their true feelings most clearly.

Even simple things like your cartoon drawings can stoop to become something more artistic with practice. When you ride your scooter, you're transforming energy from your pushing motion into forward movement.
