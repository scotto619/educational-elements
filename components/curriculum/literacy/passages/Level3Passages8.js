"Whose cake was it anyhow?" asked her little brother Jake, trying to look innocent. Emma knew that many people in their family loved chocolate cake, but someone was not telling the truth.

"I don't think anybody would take the whole thing without asking," said Mom. "But anyone could have taken just a piece. Did you check anywhere else in the house?"

Emma decided she would search anywhere the cake might be hidden. She looked anytime she had a free moment, but couldn't find anything.

Finally, Dad confessed with a smile. "I ate the whole cake early this morning before anyone was awake. I couldn't help myself - it smelled so good!"

"Well, anyhow, now we know who the cake thief is," laughed Emma. "But you can't do that anymore, Dad!"

Dad promised he wouldn't take anything that wasn't his without asking. The whole family agreed that was much better than solving mysteries all day.`

Start by thinking about who might know the answer to your question. Whose knowledge would be most helpful? Many people enjoy sharing what they know, so don't be afraid to ask anybody for help.

You can ask questions anytime - not just in school. Anyone who is curious can learn anywhere they go. The whole world is full of interesting things to discover.

Some good question words include "who," "whose," "when," "where," "why," and "how." Anyhow you phrase your question, make sure it's clear and specific.

Don't worry if you can't think of anything to ask right away. Many people start conversations by asking simple questions like "Who are you?" or "What do you like to do?"

Remember, anybody can be a good questioner. You don't need anything special except curiosity and the willingness to listen to the whole answer.`

You can show kindness anywhere - at school, at home, or anytime you're out in public. Anybody can make a difference with simple acts of caring.

Anyhow you choose to be kind, remember that many small actions add up to something big. You could help anyone who needs assistance, or simply smile at anybody you pass on the street.

The whole point of being kind is not to get anything back, but to make the world better for everyone. Don't wait until you're older to start - anybody can be kind right now!

Who knows? Your kindness might inspire anyone you meet to be kinder too. Anytime you're kind to anybody, anywhere, you're making the whole world a little bit better.`

Many people need a friend,
Anyone can help or lend
Anything that brings them cheer,
Anytime throughout the year.

Whose idea was it anyhow,
That kindness only matters now?
Anybody, anywhere can see
That kindness sets the whole world free.

So anytime you're feeling small,
Remember you can help us all.
Anyone, anywhere, anytime,
Can make the whole world shine!`

Birds couldn't fly if they didn't have the right feathers and wing shapes. They would lose their ability to find food and escape danger if you were to remove their flight feathers.

Fish move through water in ways that would seem impossible on land. They couldn't swim efficiently if you tried to disprove the laws of physics that help them glide through water.

Some animals should move quickly to catch prey, while others move slowly to save energy. Scientists approve of studying these patterns because it helps us understand how animals adapt to their environments.

Animals couldn't lose their natural movement abilities even if humans tried to reprove evolution. Each creature's way of moving has developed over millions of years.

Would you believe that some animals can move without using any legs at all? Snakes prove that there are many different ways to travel successfully through the world.`

You could try many different activities - you couldn't lose by experimenting with sports, dancing, or just playing outside. Movement doesn't have to be boring or difficult.

Some people think they couldn't find time for exercise, but that's not true. You should look for small ways to move throughout the day. You could take the stairs instead of elevators, or walk instead of riding everywhere.

Scientists prove that regular movement helps your brain work better too. You couldn't ask for a better way to improve both your body and your mind!

Don't reprove yourself if you miss a day - just start again tomorrow. You would be amazed at how good daily movement makes you feel.`

To move your dreams up to the sky!`

"This weather might threaten our camping trip," Dad said, looking worried. "The heavy rain could make the trails dangerous instead of fun."

But by lunch time, the sun was shining again. Emma took a deep breath of the fresh, clean air. Instead of being upset about the weather, she felt grateful.

Start each day with a healthy breakfast instead of skipping the most important meal. Your body is already working hard while you sleep, so it needs good fuel to start the day right.

Take deep breaths of fresh air whenever possible. The weather outside might be cold or hot, but breathing clean air helps your body stay strong. Even if the air feels heavy, getting outside is better than staying inside all day.

Exercise keeps your muscles from becoming too heavy and sluggish. Instead of sitting around, try activities that make you catch your breath in a healthy way.

Wear appropriate clothes for the weather. Leather jackets protect you from wind, while light clothes like feather-soft cotton help in hot weather.

Don't let illness threaten your health by ignoring warning signs. If you already feel sick, rest instead of pushing yourself too hard. Your body knows when it needs to heal.`

Some people think reading is boring, but they couldn't be more dead wrong! Books can take you anywhere, from exploring heavy weather on the ocean to finding a magical feather that grants wishes.

Reading helps exercise your brain instead of letting it become lazy. Your head will feel sharper and more alert when you read regularly, just like your body feels stronger when you exercise.

Even if the weather outside seems perfect for playing, you should already have reading time planned into your day. Keep a book in your leather backpack so you can read anywhere.

Don't let busy schedules threaten your reading habit. Instead of making excuses, find small moments throughout the day to read and grow your mind.`

Then step outside to breathe fresh air.
Instead of fearing wind and storm,
I'll find a coat to keep me warm.

A feather floats down from the sky,
As heavy clouds go sailing by.
Already wet from morning dew,
The earth drinks water, fresh and new.

Don't let the weather make you sad,
Instead of that, let's all be glad.
The breath of wind, the storm clouds' head,
Bring life to gardens, never dead.

So when the weather seems to threaten,
Don't let your spirits get downbeaten.
Heavy rain and sunshine too
Make weather wonderful for me and you!`

Uncle Tom smiled. "Nothing here needs to crumble if we take good care of it. Even a simple beetle has its place in nature, and even old candles can sparkle again with a little attention."

Some insects, like the eagle of the insect world - the dragonfly - help control mosquitoes. Others are as small as the point of a needle but work hard to help flowers grow and twinkle in the sunlight.

Even in the jungle, insects play important roles. They help clean up dead leaves and flowers that would otherwise just crumble on the ground.

You don't need to be an expert to handle garden insects properly. Simple steps like planting diverse flowers and avoiding harmful sprays can help beneficial insects sparkle in your garden.

Simple projects like making a candle don't require expensive materials or complicated tools. You just need to be willing to learn and not let your patience crumble when things don't work perfectly the first time.

Even if your first attempts don't twinkle with perfection, keep practicing! Every expert was once a beginner who had to handle their tools awkwardly at first.

Don't let technology make traditional crafts crumble away. Your uncle or grandmother might know simple skills that you could learn. These abilities make you more creative and help you handle problems with your own hands instead of relying on others.
