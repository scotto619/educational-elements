"Don't forget the sunscreen," Mom called as they ran toward the water. Tommy felt his throat get tight with excitement as he watched the boats float peacefully on the calm blue water.

For breakfast, they ate warm toast with jam while sitting on the sandy beach. Sarah began to boast about how far she could swim, but Tommy just smiled. He didn't want to groan about his sister showing off.

Later, they built a sandcastle near a wooden fence post. A seagull landed nearby, making gross squawking sounds as it searched for food scraps. Both kids laughed at the funny bird.

As the sun set over the coast, their dad made a campfire. They roasted marshmallows and watched them float in their hot chocolate. It was the most perfect day at the beach either of them could remember.`

First, don't swim alone. Always have a grown-up host your swimming activities. If you start to feel scared, don't be afraid to groan or call for help. Many people get a tight feeling in their throat when they're frightened, and that's normal.

Second, learn to float on your back. This skill can save your life if you get tired while swimming. Don't boast about being a strong swimmer if you're still learning - it's better to be honest about your abilities.

Third, stay away from gross or polluted water. Never drink ocean water, as it will make you sick. Look for warning signs posted on fence posts near the beach.

Finally, eat a good breakfast like toast and fruit before swimming. This gives you energy, but don't swim right after eating. Most safety experts say to wait at least 30 minutes after meals.`

Every piece of litter that floats in the ocean can hurt sea animals. When you visit the beach, don't leave behind sandwich crusts from your toast or empty bottles. Fish and birds might eat these things and get sick. You might hear them groan in pain if they swallow something harmful.

Many communities host beach cleanup days where volunteers remove trash. Don't boast about helping - just quietly do your part. Look for garbage near fence posts, under piers, and along the water's edge where trash tends to collect.

The throat of our rivers leads to the ocean, so even trash from far inland can end up on the coast. Most of the plastic in our oceans comes from people who don't care about the environment.

Be the kind of person who leaves only footprints in the sand. Both future visitors and ocean creatures will thank you for keeping our beaches clean!`

While children build castles of clay.
Though their sounds seem rather gross,
They're the birds we love the most.

Morning toast tastes extra sweet
When your throat feels ocean breeze.
Don't boast about your swimming skills,
Just enjoy these seaside thrills.

Host a picnic on the sand,
Both your friends will think it's grand.
Watch the waves float to the shore,
This is what we're living for.

By each post and weathered pier,
Coast adventures bring us cheer.
Most of all, I love to be
Where the land meets the blue sea!`

"First, you need to know the right way to work with dough," Grandma said with a smile. She showed Emma how to knead the mixture by pushing it with the heel of her hand, then folding it over with her thumb.

Emma had to kneel on a chair to reach the counter properly. She used a wooden comb to create pretty patterns on top of the bread. A tiny crumb fell on the floor, and their little lamb-colored cat quickly came to investigate.

Grandma carefully used a sharp knife to score the top of the loaves. Emma knew she wasn't old enough to handle knives yet, but she could knock gently on the finished bread to test if it was done.

After working so hard, Emma's hands felt numb from all the kneading. But when she bit into the warm bread, every limb in her body felt happy and satisfied.`

When you knead bread or pizza dough, use your whole hand, not just your thumb. Push the dough away from you, then fold it back over itself. If a crumb falls on the floor, clean it up right away so no one slips.

Always knock before entering someone else's kitchen, and ask permission before touching anything. You should kneel down to look at things cooking in the oven, but never open the oven door without an adult present.

Keep your hair tied back with a comb or hair tie so it doesn't get near the stove. If you accidentally touch something hot, your skin might feel numb for a moment - run cold water over the area immediately.

If you knew how to handle a kitchen knife properly, you still shouldn't use one without adult supervision. Even professional chefs sometimes hurt a finger or limb when they're not careful.`

Our grandparents knew how to knead bread dough and use basic tools like a knife safely. They could knock together a delicious meal from simple ingredients. They knew how to comb a sheep's wool and care for a gentle lamb.

Many young people today have become numb to these valuable skills because everything comes pre-made from stores. They don't know the satisfaction of creating something with their own hands, using every limb and muscle to work hard.

Learn to kneel in a garden and grow your own food. Know the feeling of flour crumbs on your fingers and the pride of making something from scratch. Use your thumb to test if bread is done, just like people knew how to do for thousands of years.

These skills connect us to our history and teach us to be independent. If you knew how to do these things, you would never go hungry or feel helpless in a crisis.`

Some letters hide and don't make a sound.
The 'k' in 'knock' stays quiet and still,
While 'n' makes the noise that we hear around.

When I knead the bread, my thumb gets strong,
The 'k' is silent but the word lives on.
I knew this rule since I was small,
Silent letters don't talk at all.

The lamb runs free across the ground,
Its 'b' is silent, makes no sound.
I kneel to pet its woolly limb,
My comb can't catch what's silent in him.

A tiny crumb falls from my knife,
These silent letters add to life.
Though some feel numb to spelling rules,
Silent letters are useful tools.

So when you know and when you've knew,
Remember letters silent too!`

Dad showed Jake how to cook the perfect burger over the campfire. "Don't let the meat get burnt," he warned. Jake tried to understand the right way to flip the patties so they would cook evenly.

When you're thirsty, don't just let the water squirt from the faucet while you wait for it to get cold. This wastes water that other people need. Instead, keep a pitcher of cold water in the refrigerator so you don't have to let water run.

In western states where water is scarce, people work hard to transfer water from rivers to cities. Farmers need water for crops, and even a simple burger requires water to raise cattle and grow vegetables.

Don't leave dirty dishes sitting with water running over them. This can waste over thirteen gallons per day! When you return dishes to the cupboard, remember that clean water helped make them spotless.

Even if you're only thirteen years old, you can help by taking shorter showers and turning off the tap while brushing your teeth. These small actions create the perfect foundation for protecting our water supply.`

When you transfer your trust to new flavors, amazing things happen. You might discover that a spicy curry won't make you squirt tears, or that sushi isn't scary at all. Even if you're only thirteen, you can learn to appreciate foods that seemed strange before.

Don't let burnt or poorly cooked examples of new foods ruin your opinion. The perfect way to try something new is to find a good restaurant or cook who can prepare it correctly.

Return to your comfort foods sometimes, but don't let them be the only things you eat. Understanding different cuisines helps you understand different people and cultures. Be thirsty for knowledge about the whole world, including its amazing foods!`

Western life makes spirits free.

Perfect place for one and all!`

Following the yellow arrow had led her to this peaceful spot where deer and other animals came to drink from the shallow water. Sophie decided not to annoy the wildlife by making noise. Instead, she sat quietly on the cotton pillow and watched the forest animals.

Some mammals make nests in hollow trees, using materials like cotton from plants or soft grasses. Others might follow a stream to find the right spot for drinking water. A yellow butterfly or colorful arrow-shaped leaf might lead you to discover where animals live.

In a farm paddock, domestic animals like sheep rest on soft ground instead of a pillow. Wild mammals often annoy farmers by eating crops, but they're just following their instincts to find food.

Don't follow wild animals too closely, as this might annoy or frighten them. Use binoculars to watch mammals from a distance. It's funny how many animals you can spot if you sit very still and quiet.

A cotton blanket or warm pillow might seem perfect to us, but animals prefer natural materials like leaves, moss, and grass. Every mammal has adapted to survive in their specific environment, whether it's a hollow log or a shallow cave.`

It's funny how many people think animals can just move somewhere else when their homes are destroyed. But every mammal needs specific conditions to survive - the right food, water, and shelter. A hollow tree that took fifty years to grow can't be replaced by a human-made substitute.

You can follow simple rules to help: don't litter in natural areas, don't pick flowers or break branches, and don't annoy animals by getting too close. Keep your dog on a leash in wildlife areas so it doesn't chase animals from their homes.

Even a shallow stream or small paddock can be home to dozens of different mammals. Protect these special places for future generations to enjoy!`

A teacher needs to be patient and not lose their temper when students make an error. Teachers use paper, books, and computers to help children learn new things. In winter, a teacher might wear a warm jumper to stay comfortable in the classroom.

An actor memorizes lines from a script written on paper. They practice in front of a mirror and learn to control their voice and body movements. Sometimes an actor might get stage fright and feel a tremor of nervousness before performing.

A sailor works on ships and boats, traveling on the ocean for longer periods of time. They need to be brave during winter storms and rough weather. A sailor must keep their temper calm even when facing dangerous situations.
