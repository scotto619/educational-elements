She turned to the last page of her script one more time, hoping the words wouldn't change before her performance. Maya tried not to feel rage toward her little brother, who had put her pet hamster's cage right next to her practice space this morning.

"Don't let fear make you cringe," her drama teacher said kindly. "This is your chance to change from a nervous student into a confident performer. The stage may seem huge, but it's just another place to share your talent."

When the orange stage lights came on, Maya felt a huge wave of confidence wash over her. She didn't cringe or feel nervous anymore. Instead, she felt ready to change the audience's mood with her performance.

The large crowd gave her a standing ovation. Maya realized that sometimes you have to plunge into scary situations to discover how brave you really are.`

First, a butterfly lays eggs on a large green leaf. Each tiny egg is about the size of a pinhead and has a slight orange tinge. The butterfly chooses each page of leaves carefully to give her babies the best start in life.

Next, caterpillars hatch and begin eating. They grow so fast that they plunge into eating almost constantly! When a caterpillar gets too large for its skin, it doesn't feel rage - it just sheds the old skin like taking off tight clothes.

Finally, the caterpillar makes a huge change by forming a chrysalis, which is like a special cage for transformation. The hinge of this natural container protects the caterpillar while it changes into a butterfly.

This amazing change from crawling caterpillar to flying butterfly happens on nature's stage. The large wings that emerge often have beautiful orange patterns and colorful designs.`

Change can have an orange tinge of excitement if you let it! Think of it as stepping onto a new stage where you can discover talents you never knew you had. The hinge between your old life and new experiences opens doors to amazing possibilities.

Even small changes can lead to huge improvements. Maybe you'll plunge into a new hobby or make friends with someone completely different from you. Don't let fear make you cringe away from trying new foods, activities, or experiences.

Change is the large force that helps you grow from who you are into who you're meant to become!`

Orange leaves fall from the tree,
Huge changes for you and me.

Life swings on a changing hinge.

Change makes everything align.
On this stage we call our life,
Change cuts worry like a knife!`

"I pledge to be brave," Tommy whispered to himself as he carefully stepped onto the first wooden plank. A small bird gave him a gentle nudge of encouragement from its perch on the nearby hedge.

Halfway across the bridge, Tommy had to dodge a low-hanging branch. He wished he had eaten more porridge for breakfast to give him extra strength! The bridge creaked under his feet, but he didn't want to judge it too harshly - it had probably been helping people cross this stream for many years.

When Tommy reached the other side, he discovered a cozy mountain lodge hidden behind the trees. An old man sat on the ledge of the porch, stirring a pot of warm porridge.

"Well done, young man," the old man said. "You didn't let fear make you dodge this adventure. Sometimes the wobbliest bridge leads to the most wonderful places."`

Every bridge needs solid support at each edge where it meets the land. Engineers use special tools, including a wedge-shaped instrument, to make sure everything fits perfectly. They pledge to follow strict safety rules during construction.

Some bridges cross deep valleys where you might see a mountain lodge far below on a rocky ledge. Other bridges help people avoid having to trudge through swampy areas or dodge traffic on busy roads.

Workers often stay in a temporary lodge near the construction site while building large bridges. They might eat simple meals like porridge to keep their energy up during long work days.

A hedge of safety barriers protects workers from falling off the edge during construction. Even a small nudge from strong wind could be dangerous when working on tall bridges, so safety always comes first.`

If you promise to visit your grandparents at their mountain lodge, don't try to dodge the trip because something more fun comes up. They might be sitting on the ledge of their porch, eating warm porridge and waiting for your visit.

Sometimes keeping promises means you have to nudge yourself to do the right thing, even when it's hard. Maybe you have to trudge through a boring task or cross a scary bridge of uncertainty.

A broken promise can damage friendships like a fallen bridge. Build trust by keeping your word!`

Trudge through challenges with care.

Her little brother would fidget with her new camping gadget - a special compass that helped hikers find their way. "Don't smudge the glass," Emma warned him as he handled the delicate instrument.

At camp, Emma learned not to hold a grudge when things went wrong. When she accidentally dropped her homemade fudge in the dirt, she didn't get upset. Instead, she shared her extra granola bars with everyone.

The campsite was near a rocky ridge where they spotted a family of badger animals digging in the ground. Emma's counselor was as small as a midget compared to the tall pine trees, but she knew everything about outdoor survival.

On the final day, Emma successfully earned her badge by demonstrating all her camping skills. She carefully stored her new gadget in the fridge when she got home, proud of her outdoor adventure and accomplishment.`

If you want to earn a responsibility badge from your family, show that you can fidget less with expensive items and take better care of your belongings. Don't smudge your tablet screen or leave sticky fingerprints on electronic gadgets.

Even a small budget can stretch far if you're careful. You don't need to spend like a rich person to have fun. Sometimes the simplest activities, like hiking on a mountain ridge or watching a badger family in the woods, cost nothing at all.

Even if someone made you fidget with worry or messed up your carefully planned budget for a special purchase, remember that everyone makes mistakes. You've probably received a badge or reward for good behavior, but you've also had times when you needed forgiveness too.

Holding grudges is like keeping a negative ledger of all the wrong things people have done. This makes you as grumpy as a badger protecting its den! Instead, choose to focus on the positive things people do.

Whether someone is as big as a giant or as small as a midget, they deserve your forgiveness when they sincerely apologize. Let go of anger and make room for happiness instead!`

Blessings from the stars above.
Badger thoughts that make you mad
Only make your spirit sad.

Let your grudges fade away!

Leave your angry thoughts behind!`

Fish don't breathe air like we do. Instead, they use their gills to take oxygen from the water. A fish would tear its delicate gills if it tried to breathe regular air above water.

Mammals like dogs, cats, and bears have hair or fur covering their bodies, but they still need to breathe fresh air through their noses and mouths. You might wear a warm coat in winter, but animals grow their own thick hair to stay warm.
