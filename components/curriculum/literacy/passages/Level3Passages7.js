One morning, Maya heard a soft sound near the porch. When she looked outside, she could see a young deer standing very close to the house. The deer didn't seem to fear her presence.

"Come here, dear," Maya whispered softly, trying not to make the deer veer away from the cabin. The deer's eyes were clear and gentle as it looked at her.

Maya watched as the deer moved to eat grass near the garden. She could hear birds starting to cheer in the trees above. The morning light made everything look crystal clear.

When her grandmother came outside, she didn't jeer at Maya for talking to the deer. Instead, she said, "That deer has been coming near our cabin every year. It seems to think we're friends."

Maya smiled, knowing this would be a dear memory she would treasure for many years to come.`

When you hear a sound, it travels through the air to reach your ear. The clear path that sound takes can be traced from the source to your eardrum. Even a deer walking nearby creates sound waves that we can hear.

Your outer ear is designed to catch sounds and steer them toward your inner ear. The shape helps sounds veer into the right direction so you can hear them clearly.

Some people might jeer at the idea that we can hear very quiet sounds, but our ears are sensitive enough to detect even a whisper. You can peer at a friend from across the room and still hear them clearly.

Animals like deer have even better hearing than people. They can hear sounds that are near and far, helping them stay safe in the wild. This ability is very dear to their survival.`

Some people might jeer at the idea of sitting quietly in nature, but listening carefully can bring clear benefits to your mind and body. The peaceful sounds can help reduce stress and make you feel more connected to the world.

You don't need to steer far from home to find nature's sounds. Even in your backyard, you can hear insects, birds, and other creatures. The clear beauty of these sounds is always near you.

Make it your goal this year to spend more time outside. Listen with clear attention, and you'll discover that nature has many dear sounds to share with you.`

I love to hear them year by year.

Some people jeer at those who listen,
But missing sounds would make tears glisten.
The deer, the birds, the wind so near,
These precious sounds I hold so dear.

So peer outside and lend your ear,
The sweetest sounds are always near.
Each year brings new ones you can hear,
These natural sounds we should all cheer!`

Many pioneers were weary from their difficult journeys, but they never gave up. Even when facing challenges as small as an earwig in their food or as large as dangerous weather, they continued forward.

Some people might try to recruit youth into unhealthy eating habits, but you can make smart choices. Even exotic birds like the toucan eat mostly fruit in the wild, showing us that natural foods are best.

A group of friends can help each other choose healthy options. When you work together, it's easier to drink more juice, eat more fruit, and avoid foods that aren't good for growing youth.

Gardening helps heal the world like medicine heals a wound or bruise. When youth learn to grow their own food, they understand where healthy juice and fresh fruit really come from.

Some students think gardening is boring, but our group has proven that wrong! We've had students go on to cruise through agricultural college and become professional farmers.
