Let's look at this word together. Can anyone see TWO words hiding inside this word?

PLAY → the base word 🎮
PLAYING → we added ING! ✨
PLAYED → we added ED! 🎯
PLAYER → we added ER! 🏆

Look! Same base word (PLAY) but we made FOUR different words!

The parts we ADD to the base are called AFFIXES. They're like word decorations that change the meaning!

Let's try another one:

JUMP → the base word 🦘
JUMPING → add ING
JUMPED → add ED  
JUMPER → add ER

Can you spot the base word in each one? That's right - JUMP! 

What do you notice? When we add these parts, we change WHEN something happens or WHO is doing it!

• JUMPED → already happened
• JUMPING → happening right now

Base: HELP 🤝

Look at how we're building word families! They all have the same base!

Here's something COOL: Sometimes the base word changes a tiny bit. Watch:

Base: RUN 🏃

• RUN + ER = RUNNER (we double the N!)

SING 🎤

A PREFIX is a part we add to the BEGINNING (the front) of a base word.

PRE means BEFORE
FIX means ATTACH

So PREFIX = attach BEFORE the base!

[Draw a train with three cars: PREFIX car, BASE car (engine), SUFFIX car]

See? The PREFIX car goes at the FRONT of the train!

Let's look at some prefixes:

UN- is a prefix that means NOT

[Write examples with the prefix in one color, base in another]

UN + HAPPY = UNHAPPY 😢
(not happy)

UN + LOCK = UNLOCK 🔓
(not locked/open the lock)

UN + TIE = UNTIE 🎀
(not tied/undo the tie)

See? UN- goes BEFORE the base and changes the meaning to mean NOT or OPPOSITE!

Let's try another prefix:

RE- means AGAIN

RE + PLAY = REPLAY 🔄
(play again)

RE + DO = REDO ✏️
(do again)

RE + READ = REREAD 📖
(read again)

Wow! You're learning prefixes! Let's practice:

If HEAT means to make hot 🔥, what does REHEAT mean?
[Wait for response: heat again!]

If TIE means to tie something 🎀, what does UNTIE mean?
[Wait for response: to undo/not tied!]

Perfect! Prefixes go at the BEGINNING! 🎯`,

A SUFFIX is a part we add to the END of a base word.

[Point to the train diagram]

See? The SUFFIX car goes at the BACK of the train!

We actually already know some suffixes! Remember -ing, -ed, and -er?

Those are SUFFIXES! They go AFTER the base!

[Write examples with base in one color, suffix in another]

PLAY + ING = PLAYING ▶️
(suffix -ing shows it's happening now)

PLAY + ED = PLAYED ⏸️
(suffix -ed shows it already happened)

PLAY + ER = PLAYER 👤
(suffix -er shows a person who does it)

Let's try more suffixes:

-FUL means FULL OF

CARE + FUL = CAREFUL 🚸
(full of care)

COLOR + FUL = COLORFUL 🌈
(full of color)

HELP + FUL = HELPFUL 🤝
(full of help)

-LESS means WITHOUT

CARE + LESS = CARELESS 🙈
(without care)

HELP + LESS = HELPLESS 😢
(without help)

First part: DOG 🐕
- This is our BASE word
- It means ONE animal - a dog!

Second part: -S
- This is our SUFFIX
- It means MORE THAN ONE!

So DOGS = DOG + S = MORE THAN ONE DOG! 🐕🐕🐕

Both parts are MEANINGFUL! They both tell us something!
- DOG tells us WHAT animal
- S tells us HOW MANY (more than one!)

Let's try another one:

CATS 🐱

Part 1: CAT 🐱 (one cat)
Part 2: -S (more than one!)

CATS = CAT + S = MORE THAN ONE CAT! 🐱🐱🐱

Each part means something important!

- BED = one bed (the thing we sleep on)
- -S = more than one
- BEDS = more than one bed!

HATS 🎩
- HAT = one hat (thing we wear)
- -S = more than one
- HATS = more than one hat!

PIGS 🐷
- PIG = one pig (the animal)
- -S = more than one

Last time we learned that words have meaningful parts, and the suffix -S means "more than one"!

Today we're going to practice ADDING the -S ourselves! We're going to turn words that mean ONE thing into words that mean MANY things!

[Write on board: "ONE → MANY"]

Are you ready to become plural experts? Let's go! 🚀`,

          content: `Here's the super easy rule for adding -S:

[Write on board with big arrows]

CAT → CAT + S → CATS

Look what happened! We:
1. Started with CAT
2. Added -S to the end
3. The CAT part stayed THE SAME!

That's the important part: THE BASE WORD DOESN'T CHANGE! We just add -S to the end!

Let's try more together:

DOG → DOG + S → DOGS
[Point to DOG] See? DOG stayed the same!
[Point to -S] We just added -S!

HAT → HAT + S → HATS
[Point to HAT] HAT stayed the same!
[Point to -S] We just added -S!

PIG → PIG + S → PIGS
BUG → BUG + S → BUGS
CUP → CUP + S → CUPS

Notice: The base word NEVER changes! We just add -S!

[Draw a visual: CAT (in a box) + S (in a circle) = CATS]

Think of it like this:
- The base word is safe in a box - it doesn't change!
- We just glue the -S on the end!
- Easy! 🎯

Let me show you with letters:

[Use magnetic letters or write clearly]

C-A-T
Now watch... I add -S
C-A-T-S

Did CAT change? NO! We just added -S! 

Your turn to help! I'll write the base word, you tell me how to spell the plural!

BED → BED + S = ? (BEDS!)
PEN → PEN + S = ? (PENS!)
TOP → TOP + S = ? (TOPS!)

You're naturals at this! 🌟`,

          content: `Now let's practice adding -S to different words!

[Write base words on the board, students help add -S]

Here's our base: BAT 🦇
Let's add -S... BATS!
[Write it out: B-A-T-S]

Base: RAT 🐀
Add -S... RATS!
[Write it out: R-A-T-S]

Base: NET 🥅
Add -S... NETS!
[Write it out: N-E-T-S]

Base: BIN 🗑️
Add -S... BINS!
[Write it out: B-I-N-S]

Let me test you! What base word do you see in these plurals?

CATS → What's the base? (CAT!)
DOGS → What's the base? (DOG!)
BEDS → What's the base? (BED!)

Perfect! You can see that the base stays the same!

Now I'm going to give you some base words, and YOU add the -S!

[Have students use whiteboards or call out answers]

• FOX → (FOXES - ooh, we'll learn about this one later!)
• Actually, let's stick to simple ones today:

• SUN ☀️ → (SUNS!)
• BUS 🚌 → (BUSES - save for later!)
• Let's do: BEE 🐝 → (BEES!)
• COW 🐄 → (COWS!)

CATS → Read it! 🐱🐱
HATS → Read it! 🎩🎩
DOGS → Read it! 🐕🐕
PIGS → Read it! 🐷🐷
BUGS → Read it! 🐛🐛

Excellent reading! 

Now let's read them in sentences!

"She has three HATS."
"The DOGS are playing."
"Five PIGS are in the mud."

✅ We can ADD -S to base words to make plurals!
✅ The base word STAYS THE SAME - it doesn't change!
✅ Just add -S to the end!
✅ CAT + S = CATS (one cat → many cats!)

Keep practicing! Next time we'll learn about some special words that are a bit trickier! 

But for now, you're AMAZING at adding -S! Give yourselves a round of applause! 👏`,
